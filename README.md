# ArgoCD Deployment Buildkite Plugin

A Buildkite plugin for deploying and rolling back ArgoCD applications with comprehensive health monitoring, log collection, and notification capabilities.

## Prerequisites

### Required CLI Tools

The plugin requires the following tools to be pre-installed on your Buildkite agents:

- **ArgoCD CLI** (`argocd`) - [Installation Guide](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cli_installation/)
- **jq** - JSON processor

> **Note**: The plugin does not automatically install these tools to support air-gapped/isolated network environments. Please ensure they are available on your Buildkite agents before using this plugin.

## Authentication

The plugin requires ArgoCD authentication via environment variables. You must set these before your ArgoCD plugin steps:

### Required Environment Variables

- `ARGOCD_SERVER` - ArgoCD server URL (can be set in the plugin step)
- `ARGOCD_USERNAME` - ArgoCD username (can be set in the plugin step)
- `ARGOCD_PASSWORD` - ArgoCD password (use your desired 3rd party secret management solution and fetched before the ArgoCD plugin steps)

```yaml
steps:
  # Fetch secrets once for entire pipeline
  - label: "üîê Fetch ArgoCD Credentials"
    key: "fetch-argocd-secrets"
    plugins:
      # Choose your secret management solution:
      - secrets#v1.0.0:                    # Buildkite Secrets
          env:
            ARGOCD_PASSWORD: your-secret-key
      # OR
      - vault-secrets#v2.2.1:              # HashiCorp Vault
          server: ${VAULT_ADDR}
          secrets:
            - path: secret/argocd/password
              field: ARGOCD_PASSWORD
      # OR  
      - aws-sm#v1.0.0:                     # AWS Secrets Manager
          secrets:
            - name: ARGOCD_PASSWORD
              key: argocd/password
      # OR
      - aws-ssm#v1.0.0:                    # AWS SSM Parameter Store
          parameters:
            ARGOCD_PASSWORD: /argocd/password
            
  # All ArgoCD steps use the fetched credentials
  - label: "üöÄ Deploy Application"
    depends_on: "fetch-argocd-secrets"
    plugins:
      - argocd_deployment#v1.0.0:
          app: "my-app"
          argocd_server: "https://argocd.example.com" # if not set in environment variables
          argocd_username: "admin" # if not set in environment variables
```

## Usage Patterns

### Production: Auto-rollback (Recommended)

Safe deployments with automatic rollback on health check failures:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "üöÄ Deploy Application"
    plugins:
      - secrets#v1.0.0:
          variables:
            ARGOCD_PASSWORD: argocd_password
      - argocd_deployment#v1.0.0:
          app: "my-app"
          argocd_server: "https://argocd.example.com"
          argocd_username: "admin"
          mode: "deploy"
          rollback_mode: "auto"  # Automatic rollback on failure
          health_check: true
          collect_logs: true
          upload_artifacts: true
```

### Development: Manual Rollback Control

Manual rollback workflow with interactive block steps for user decision:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "üö´ Deploy with Manual Rollback"
    plugins:
      - secrets#v1.0.0:
          variables:
            ARGOCD_PASSWORD: argocd_password
      - argocd_deployment#v1.0.0:
          app: "my-app"
          argocd_server: "https://argocd.example.com"
          argocd_username: "admin"
          mode: "deploy"
          rollback_mode: "manual"  # Interactive rollback decision
          health_check: true
          collect_logs: true
          upload_artifacts: true
          notifications:
            slack_channel: "#deployments"
```

### Manual Rollback Operation

Explicit rollback to a specific revision:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "üîÑ Manual Rollback"
    plugins:
      - secrets#v1.0.0:
          variables:
            ARGOCD_PASSWORD: argocd_password
      - argocd_deployment#v1.0.0:
          app: "my-app"
          argocd_server: "https://argocd.example.com"
          argocd_username: "admin"
          mode: "rollback"
          target_revision: "123"  # ArgoCD History ID or Git SHA
          collect_logs: true
          upload_artifacts: true
```

## Workflow

### Deploy Mode

1. **Validation**: Plugin validates ArgoCD connectivity and application existence
2. **Pre-deployment**: Captures current application state and revision for rollback
3. **Deployment**: Executes ArgoCD sync operation
4. **Health Monitoring**: Monitors application health via ArgoCD API (always enabled)
   - **Auto mode**: Completes full health check cycle, then automatic rollback on failure
   - **Manual mode**: Fails immediately on first failure to save time, then interactive block step
5. **Failure Handling**:
   - **Auto mode**: Automatic rollback to previous stable version with smart rollback logic (auto-sync management)
   - **Manual mode**: Interactive block step for user decision
6. **Log Collection**: Collects ArgoCD app logs and pod logs (if enabled)
7. **Artifact Upload**: Uploads logs and deployment artifacts to Buildkite
8. **Notifications**: Sends Slack notifications on rollback events
9. **Annotations**: Creates beautiful success/failure annotations with detailed information

### Rollback Mode

1. **Validation**: Plugin validates ArgoCD connectivity and target revision
2. **Rollback Execution**: Executes ArgoCD rollback to specified revision
3. **Log Collection**: Collects ArgoCD app logs and pod logs (if enabled)
4. **Artifact Upload**: Uploads logs and deployment artifacts to Buildkite
5. **Notifications**: Sends Slack notifications on rollback events
6. **Annotations**: Creates beautiful success/failure annotations with detailed information
